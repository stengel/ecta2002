compiled with GNU Make version 3.77,

gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

but it should not matter much.  

The file Depend must be present for make to run,
"touch Depend" and "make depend" will bring it up to date
(it is up to date at the moment).

The most important thing is the presence of the GNU
GMP library (GNU multiple precision arithmetic).
If this does not work, I have an independent implementation
as well.  Please send email to
